Apache Groovy is a multi-faceted, multi-paradigm programming language for the JVM that offers a wealth of features that make it ideal for transforming big data into usable solutions. 

- It has a dynamic nature like Python, which means that it is very powerful, easy to learn, and productive.
- It has a static nature like Java and Kotlin, which makes it fast when needed.
- And it has first-class functional support, meaning that it offers features and allows solutions similar to Scala.

In this complimentary webinar, [Object Computing Groovy Practice Lead, Paul King](https://objectcomputing.com/products/2gm-team#king), reviews the key benefits of using Groovy to develop data science solutions, including integration with various JDK libraries commonly used in data science solutions.
