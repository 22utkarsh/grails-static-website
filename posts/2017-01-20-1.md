In this video, Grails co-founder Graeme Rocher walks you through multi-project builds in Grails.

Grails does a few handy things with multi-project builds and plugins, not the least of which being that Grails compiles your plugins first and puts the class and resources of those plugins directly in the classpath. This lets you make changes to your plugins and instantly see those changes in your build.

Grails Quickcasts, brought to you through a partnership between [Object Computing, Inc.](https://objectcomputing.com/) (OCI) and [DZone](https://dzone.com/), provide bite-sized tutorials to help you maximize your productivity with the Framework.
