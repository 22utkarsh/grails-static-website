Vue.js is a modern, pragmatic JavaScript library designed for building user interfaces. Vue borrows good ideas from React and Angular, then adds a slew of features to enhance developer experience and productivity. Interest in Vue is through the roof, and for good reason.  

Grails includes a Vue profile for building applications with a Vue front-end. In addition, Grails offers several features that make it an ideal back-end framework for single-page apps (SPAs), including JSON views and JWT authentication with the Spring Security REST plugin.

In this webinar, 2GM (Groovy, Grails, and Micronaut) team member, [Zachary Klein](https://objectcomputing.com/products/2gm-team#klein-z), introduces the Vue.js library and walks you through a Grails project using Vue, REST, and JWT security. He completes the demonstration by demonstrating the steps necessary to build an executable JAR file with Grails and Vue.

## Outline

The following topics are covered in this webinar:

- Introduction to Vue.js
- Overview of the Vue profile for Grails
- Overview of Spring Security REST with JWT
- Demonstration of how to implement JWT security with Grails and Vue
- Demonstration of a sample project using Grails and Vue
- Demonstration of an executable JAR build with Gradle

This is a great opportunity for Grails developers to add a new skill to their coding toolboxes! General web and JVM developers are also encouraged to discover what Grails has to offer modern web development practices.
